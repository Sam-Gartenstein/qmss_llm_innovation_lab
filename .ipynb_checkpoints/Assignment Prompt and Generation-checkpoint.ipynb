    "\n",
    "#### Description:\n",
    "- This function generates a list of assignment prompts tailored to specific grade-subject pairs using the OpenAI API.\n",
    "- The function takes a list of grade-subject pairs, constructs a unique prompt for each, and requests 10 age-appropriate assignment prompts for each pair.\n",
    "- The prompts are displayed in Markdown format within Jupyter Notebooks for easy viewing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "- **pairs**: A list of tuples, where each tuple consists of:\n",
    "  - **grade_level**: A string representing the grade level (e.g., \"11\" for 11th grade).\n",
    "  - **subject**: A string representing the academic subject for which prompts are being generated (e.g., \"US History\").\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. **Prompt Construction**: For each grade-subject pair, the function builds a specific request prompt that asks the OpenAI model to generate 10 unique, challenging, and engaging assignment prompts appropriate for that grade level and subject.\n",
    "2. **API Call**: The function sends this constructed prompt to the OpenAI API (`gpt-3.5-turbo`), instructing it to generate relevant assignment ideas.\n",
    "3. **Formatting and Cleaning**: After receiving the response:\n",
    "   - Each prompt is stripped of any leading numbering or formatting inconsistencies using regular expressions to ensure a clean display.\n",
    "   - Only the first 10 prompts are kept, even if more are returned.\n",
    "4. **Display**: Each prompt is then labeled (e.g., \"Prompt 1,\" \"Prompt 2\") and displayed in Markdown format for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "- **Returns**: A dictionary (`all_prompts`) where:\n",
    "  - Each key is a tuple of the form `(grade_level, subject)`.\n",
    "  - Each value is a list of 10 formatted assignment prompts for the corresponding grade-subject pair.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Description:\n",
    "- This function generates a sample essay for each grade-subject pair based on a specific prompt and a randomly assigned quality level. \n",
    "- It leverages a previously generated list of prompts, selects a specified prompt, and instructs OpenAI to generate a sample essay typical of a student at that grade level and subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "- **all_prompts**: A dictionary where each key is a tuple `(grade_level, subject)` and each value is a list of 10 assignment prompts generated for that grade-subject pair.\n",
    "- **pairs**: A list of grade-subject tuples, where each tuple consists of:\n",

    "  - **subject**: A string representing the academic subject (e.g., \"US History\").\n",
    "- **prompt_index**: An integer indicating which prompt from the list to use for essay generation (default is 0, which selects the first prompt in the list).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. **Prompt Selection**: For each grade-subject pair in `pairs`, the function retrieves the specified prompt from `all_prompts` using `prompt_index`.\n",
    "2. **Quality Level Assignment**: A quality level (e.g., \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", or \"F\") is randomly selected for the essay using `random.choice(quality_levels)`.\n",
    "3. **Essay Generation Prompt**: An essay prompt is constructed based on the selected prompt and assigned quality level, simulating a student essay typical of that grade and subject.\n",
    "4. **API Call**: The function sends the essay prompt to the OpenAI API (`gpt-3.5-turbo`), requesting a sample response.\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**: If prompts are missing or if `prompt_index` is out of range, an error message is printed. Any API errors are caught and logged, and the essay output for that pair is set to `None`.\n",
    "6. **Display and Storage**: Each generated essay, along with its quality level, is displayed in Markdown format and stored in a dictionary for further use.\n",

    "#### Output:\n",
    "- **Returns**: A dictionary (`all_essays`) where:\n",

       "The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s was a transformative period in American history, challenging racial segregation and discrimination that had long plagued the country. As a journalist covering this pivotal movement, I have had the privilege of witnessing and documenting key events that have reshaped the course of our nation's history.\n",
       "\n",
       "One such event that stood out significantly was the Montgomery Bus Boycott, sparked by the arrest of African American seamstress Rosa Parks for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white passenger. The boycott, led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders, lasted for 381 days and served as a powerful display of nonviolent resistance against segregation. I had the opportunity to interview individuals involved in the boycott, including Rosa Parks herself. Her courage and determination to stand up for her rights inspired a community to come together in solidarity, leading to the eventual desegregation of public transportation in Montgomery.\n",
       "\n",
       "Furthermore, the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 was a monumental event that brought together over 250,000 people to advocate for civil and economic rights for African Americans. I spoke with John Lewis, a young activist and leader in the movement, who shared his experience of speaking at the historic event. The powerful speeches delivered that day, most notably Dr. King's iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech, resonated with the nation and galvanized support for civil rights legislation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Through these interviews and firsthand observations, it became evident that the Civil Rights Movement was not just a fight for equality but a struggle for dignity and justice. The courage and resilience of individuals like Rosa Parks and the eloquence of leaders like Dr. King propelled the movement forward, challenging societal norms and demanding change.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, the impact of events such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the March on Washington cannot be overstated in the context of the Civil Rights Movement. These milestones in the fight for racial equality serve as a testament to the power of collective action and the enduring legacy of those who dared to dream of a more just and inclusive society. As a journalist covering this historic period, I am humbled by the stories shared with me and the lessons learned from those who paved the way for a more equitable future."
