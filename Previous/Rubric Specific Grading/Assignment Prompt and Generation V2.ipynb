    "\n",
    "#### Description:\n",
    "- This function generates a list of assignment prompts tailored to specific grade-subject pairs using the OpenAI API.\n",
    "- The function takes a list of grade-subject pairs, constructs a unique prompt for each, and requests 10 age-appropriate assignment prompts for each pair.\n",
    "- The prompts are displayed in Markdown format within Jupyter Notebooks for easy viewing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "- **pairs**: A list of tuples, where each tuple consists of:\n",
    "  - **grade_level**: A string representing the grade level (e.g., \"11\" for 11th grade).\n",
    "  - **subject**: A string representing the academic subject for which prompts are being generated (e.g., \"US History\").\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. **Prompt Construction**: For each grade-subject pair, the function builds a specific request prompt that asks the OpenAI model to generate 10 unique, challenging, and engaging assignment prompts appropriate for that grade level and subject.\n",
    "2. **API Call**: The function sends this constructed prompt to the OpenAI API (`gpt-3.5-turbo`), instructing it to generate relevant assignment ideas.\n",
    "3. **Formatting and Cleaning**: After receiving the response:\n",
    "   - Each prompt is stripped of any leading numbering or formatting inconsistencies using regular expressions to ensure a clean display.\n",
    "   - Only the first 10 prompts are kept, even if more are returned.\n",
    "4. **Display**: Each prompt is then labeled (e.g., \"Prompt 1,\" \"Prompt 2\") and displayed in Markdown format for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "- **Returns**: A dictionary (`all_prompts`) where:\n",
    "  - Each key is a tuple of the form `(grade_level, subject)`.\n",
    "  - Each value is a list of 10 formatted assignment prompts for the corresponding grade-subject pair.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Description:\n",
    "- This function generates a sample essay for each grade-subject pair based on a specific prompt and a randomly assigned quality level. \n",
    "- It leverages a previously generated list of prompts, selects a specified prompt, and instructs OpenAI to generate a sample essay typical of a student at that grade level and subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "- **all_prompts**: A dictionary where each key is a tuple `(grade_level, subject)` and each value is a list of 10 assignment prompts generated for that grade-subject pair.\n",
    "- **pairs**: A list of grade-subject tuples, where each tuple consists of:\n",
    "  - **grade_level**: A string indicating the grade level (e.g., \"11\" for 11th grade).\n",
    "  - **subject**: A string representing the academic subject (e.g., \"US History\").\n",
    "- **prompt_index**: An integer indicating which prompt from the list to use for essay generation (default is 0, which selects the first prompt in the list).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. **Prompt Selection**: For each grade-subject pair in `pairs`, the function retrieves the specified prompt from `all_prompts` using `prompt_index`.\n",
    "2. **Quality Level Assignment**: A quality level (e.g., \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", or \"F\") is randomly selected for the essay using `random.choice(quality_levels)`.\n",
    "3. **Essay Generation Prompt**: An essay prompt is constructed based on the selected prompt and assigned quality level, simulating a student essay typical of that grade and subject.\n",
    "4. **API Call**: The function sends the essay prompt to the OpenAI API (`gpt-3.5-turbo`), requesting a sample response.\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**: If prompts are missing or if `prompt_index` is out of range, an error message is printed. Any API errors are caught and logged, and the essay output for that pair is set to `None`.\n",
    "6. **Display and Storage**: Each generated essay, along with its quality level, is displayed in Markdown format and stored in a dictionary for further use.\n",

    "#### Output:\n",
    "- **Returns**: A dictionary (`all_essays`) where:\n",

       "Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. were two influential figures during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, each with their own distinctive approaches and ideologies. While both men aimed to achieve racial equality and justice for African Americans, they followed different paths to reach this common goal.\n",
       "\n",
       "Martin Luther King Jr., a Baptist minister and a proponent of nonviolent resistance, believed in achieving civil rights through peaceful protest and civil disobedience. He promoted the idea of love and unity among all races and advocated for integration and equality. King emphasized the need for nonviolent direct action to bring about social change, famously leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott and delivering his iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech during the March on Washington. His approach was rooted in Christian principles of love, forgiveness, and nonviolence, inspiring widespread support for the Civil Rights Movement.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, Malcolm X, a prominent leader in the Nation of Islam, took a more militant and separatist stance in his fight for racial justice. He advocated for self-defense and armed resistance against white supremacy, calling for black empowerment and self-determination. Malcolm X criticized King's nonviolent approach as ineffective and believed in responding to violence with force, if necessary. His message resonated with many African Americans who felt disillusioned with the slow progress of nonviolent tactics, appealing to those seeking more radical solutions to combat racism and oppression.\n",
       "\n",
       "The differing strategies and ideologies of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. had a significant impact on the Civil Rights Movement. While King's peaceful resistance strategy gained mainstream support and led to legislative victories such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Malcolm X's advocacy for black nationalism and self-defense brought attention to the deep-rooted issues of systemic racism and challenged the status quo. Both men inspired and mobilized millions of people to fight against racial discrimination, albeit through contrasting means.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. played pivotal roles in shaping the Civil Rights Movement with their distinct approaches and ideologies. While King's commitment to nonviolent protest and integration helped progress towards racial equality, Malcolm X's militant stance sparked conversations about black empowerment and self-respect. Together, their contributions highlight the complexity and diversity of strategies within the broader fight for civil rights in America."

His message resonated with many who felt disillusioned by the slow progress of the Civil Rights Movement and sought a more assertive stance against oppression.\n",

Together, their differing strategies and ideologies enriched the Civil Rights Movement and ultimately advanced the cause of racial equality in America."

       "Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. were two influential figures during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, each with their own distinctive approaches and ideologies. While both men aimed to achieve racial equality and justice for African Americans, they followed different paths to reach this common goal.\n",
       "\n",
       "Martin Luther King Jr., a Baptist minister and a proponent of nonviolent resistance, believed in achieving civil rights through peaceful protest and civil disobedience. He promoted the idea of love and unity among all races and advocated for integration and equality. King emphasized the need for nonviolent direct action to bring about social change, famously leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott and delivering his iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech during the March on Washington. His approach was rooted in Christian principles of love, forgiveness, and nonviolence, inspiring widespread support for the Civil Rights Movement.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, Malcolm X, a prominent leader in the Nation of Islam, took a more militant and separatist stance in his fight for racial justice. He advocated for self-defense and armed resistance against white supremacy, calling for black empowerment and self-determination. Malcolm X criticized King's nonviolent approach as ineffective and believed in responding to violence with force, if necessary. His message resonated with many African Americans who felt disillusioned with the slow progress of nonviolent tactics, appealing to those seeking more radical solutions to combat racism and oppression.\n",
       "\n",
       "The differing strategies and ideologies of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. had a significant impact on the Civil Rights Movement. While King's peaceful resistance strategy gained mainstream support and led to legislative victories such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Malcolm X's advocacy for black nationalism and self-defense brought attention to the deep-rooted issues of systemic racism and challenged the status quo. Both men inspired and mobilized millions of people to fight against racial discrimination, albeit through contrasting means.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. played pivotal roles in shaping the Civil Rights Movement with their distinct approaches and ideologies. While King's commitment to nonviolent protest and integration helped progress towards racial equality, Malcolm X's militant stance sparked conversations about black empowerment and self-respect. Together, their contributions highlight the complexity and diversity of strategies within the broader fight for civil rights in America."

       "Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. were two prominent figures in the Civil Rights Movement, each with their own unique approaches and ideologies. While both leaders aimed to achieve racial equality and justice, they had distinct strategies that influenced the movement in significant ways.\n",
       "\n",
       "Malcolm X was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment and self-defense. His ideology was rooted in black nationalism and he believed in achieving freedom and equality through any means necessary, including self-defense and armed resistance. Malcolm X emphasized the importance of Black pride, self-reliance, and challenging the oppressive white power structure. He rejected nonviolence and criticized the integrationist approach of Martin Luther King Jr., arguing that Black Americans should separate themselves from whites and create their own identity and institutions.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, Martin Luther King Jr. was a proponent of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience. He believed in the power of love, peace, and passive resistance to bring about social change. King emphasized the importance of unity, integration, and working together with white allies to dismantle institutional racism and achieve equality for all. His approach was deeply rooted in Christian principles of forgiveness, love, and nonviolence, and he advocated for peaceful protests, marches, and boycotts to raise awareness and bring about legislative changes.\n",
       "\n",
       "The differing strategies and ideologies of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. had a significant impact on the Civil Rights Movement. Malcolm X's bold and confrontational tactics appealed to those who felt frustrated and marginalized by the slow progress of the movement. His emphasis on self-empowerment and self-defense inspired many to take a more assertive stance against racism and discrimination.\n",
       "\n",
       "In contrast, Martin Luther King Jr.'s commitment to nonviolence and integration resonated with a broader audience, including white supporters and moderate activists. His message of love and unity helped to galvanize a mass movement for civil rights, leading to landmark legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, the approaches of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. to the Civil Rights Movement were complementary yet divergent. While Malcolm X's militant stance highlighted the urgent need for black liberation and self-determination, King's peaceful activism paved the way for broader social change and integration. Together, their differing strategies and ideologies enriched the Civil Rights Movement and ultimately advanced the cause of racial equality in America."

       "Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. were two influential figures during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, each with their own distinctive approaches and ideologies. While both men aimed to achieve racial equality and justice for African Americans, they followed different paths to reach this common goal.\n",
       "\n",
       "Martin Luther King Jr., a Baptist minister and a proponent of nonviolent resistance, believed in achieving civil rights through peaceful protest and civil disobedience. He promoted the idea of love and unity among all races and advocated for integration and equality. King emphasized the need for nonviolent direct action to bring about social change, famously leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott and delivering his iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech during the March on Washington. His approach was rooted in Christian principles of love, forgiveness, and nonviolence, inspiring widespread support for the Civil Rights Movement.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, Malcolm X, a prominent leader in the Nation of Islam, took a more militant and separatist stance in his fight for racial justice. He advocated for self-defense and armed resistance against white supremacy, calling for black empowerment and self-determination. Malcolm X criticized King's nonviolent approach as ineffective and believed in responding to violence with force, if necessary. His message resonated with many African Americans who felt disillusioned with the slow progress of nonviolent tactics, appealing to those seeking more radical solutions to combat racism and oppression.\n",
       "\n",
       "The differing strategies and ideologies of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. had a significant impact on the Civil Rights Movement. While King's peaceful resistance strategy gained mainstream support and led to legislative victories such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Malcolm X's advocacy for black nationalism and self-defense brought attention to the deep-rooted issues of systemic racism and challenged the status quo. Both men inspired and mobilized millions of people to fight against racial discrimination, albeit through contrasting means.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. played pivotal roles in shaping the Civil Rights Movement with their distinct approaches and ideologies. While King's commitment to nonviolent protest and integration helped progress towards racial equality, Malcolm X's militant stance sparked conversations about black empowerment and self-respect. Together, their contributions highlight the complexity and diversity of strategies within the broader fight for civil rights in America."

       "\n",
       "On the other hand, Malcolm X advocated for a more radical approach to racial equality, rejecting nonviolence and promoting self-defense in response to systemic oppression. He was a proponent of Black Nationalism and believed in empowering African Americans through self-reliance and separatism. Malcolm X’s fiery speeches and critiques of white supremacy challenged the status quo and resonated with many disillusioned African Americans seeking a more assertive stance against racial injustices.\n",
       "\n",
       "These differing strategies and ideologies had a significant impact on the Civil Rights Movement. While King's nonviolent approach attracted broader support from the general public, including white Americans and political leaders, Malcolm X's advocacy for self-defense and Black empowerment appealed to those who felt marginalized and oppressed. Both leaders sparked important conversations about race, equality, and justice in America and inspired many to join the fight for civil rights.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X's contrasting approaches to the Civil Rights Movement underscored the complexity and diversity of strategies within the movement. Their legacies continue to shape discussions on race relations and activism in the United States, reminding us of the ongoing struggle for equality and social justice."

       "Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. were two prominent figures in the Civil Rights Movement, each with their own unique approaches and ideologies. While both leaders aimed to achieve racial equality and justice, they had distinct strategies that influenced the movement in significant ways.\n",
       "\n",
       "Malcolm X was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment and self-defense. His ideology was rooted in black nationalism and he believed in achieving freedom and equality through any means necessary, including self-defense and armed resistance. Malcolm X emphasized the importance of Black pride, self-reliance, and challenging the oppressive white power structure. He rejected nonviolence and criticized the integrationist approach of Martin Luther King Jr., arguing that Black Americans should separate themselves from whites and create their own identity and institutions.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, Martin Luther King Jr. was a proponent of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience. He believed in the power of love, peace, and passive resistance to bring about social change. King emphasized the importance of unity, integration, and working together with white allies to dismantle institutional racism and achieve equality for all. His approach was deeply rooted in Christian principles of forgiveness, love, and nonviolence, and he advocated for peaceful protests, marches, and boycotts to raise awareness and bring about legislative changes.\n",
       "\n",
       "The differing strategies and ideologies of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. had a significant impact on the Civil Rights Movement. Malcolm X's bold and confrontational tactics appealed to those who felt frustrated and marginalized by the slow progress of the movement. His emphasis on self-empowerment and self-defense inspired many to take a more assertive stance against racism and discrimination.\n",
       "\n",
       "In contrast, Martin Luther King Jr.'s commitment to nonviolence and integration resonated with a broader audience, including white supporters and moderate activists. His message of love and unity helped to galvanize a mass movement for civil rights, leading to landmark legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, the approaches of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. to the Civil Rights Movement were complementary yet divergent. While Malcolm X's militant stance highlighted the urgent need for black liberation and self-determination, King's peaceful activism paved the way for broader social change and integration. Together, their differing strategies and ideologies enriched the Civil Rights Movement and ultimately advanced the cause of racial equality in America."
