    "\n",
    "#### Description:\n",
    "- This function generates a list of assignment prompts tailored to specific grade-subject pairs using the OpenAI API.\n",
    "- The function takes a list of grade-subject pairs, constructs a unique prompt for each, and requests 10 age-appropriate assignment prompts for each pair.\n",
    "- The prompts are displayed in Markdown format within Jupyter Notebooks for easy viewing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "- **pairs**: A list of tuples, where each tuple consists of:\n",
    "  - **grade_level**: A string representing the grade level (e.g., \"11\" for 11th grade).\n",
    "  - **subject**: A string representing the academic subject for which prompts are being generated (e.g., \"US History\").\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. **Prompt Construction**: For each grade-subject pair, the function builds a specific request prompt that asks the OpenAI model to generate 10 unique, challenging, and engaging assignment prompts appropriate for that grade level and subject.\n",
    "2. **API Call**: The function sends this constructed prompt to the OpenAI API (`gpt-3.5-turbo`), instructing it to generate relevant assignment ideas.\n",
    "3. **Formatting and Cleaning**: After receiving the response:\n",
    "   - Each prompt is stripped of any leading numbering or formatting inconsistencies using regular expressions to ensure a clean display.\n",
    "   - Only the first 10 prompts are kept, even if more are returned.\n",
    "4. **Display**: Each prompt is then labeled (e.g., \"Prompt 1,\" \"Prompt 2\") and displayed in Markdown format for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "- **Returns**: A dictionary (`all_prompts`) where:\n",
    "  - Each key is a tuple of the form `(grade_level, subject)`.\n",
    "  - Each value is a list of 10 formatted assignment prompts for the corresponding grade-subject pair.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Description:\n",
    "- This function generates a sample essay for each grade-subject pair based on a specific prompt and a randomly assigned quality level. \n",
    "- It leverages a previously generated list of prompts, selects a specified prompt, and instructs OpenAI to generate a sample essay typical of a student at that grade level and subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "- **all_prompts**: A dictionary where each key is a tuple `(grade_level, subject)` and each value is a list of 10 assignment prompts generated for that grade-subject pair.\n",
    "- **pairs**: A list of grade-subject tuples, where each tuple consists of:\n",
    "  - **grade_level**: A string indicating the grade level (e.g., \"11\" for 11th grade).\n",
    "  - **subject**: A string representing the academic subject (e.g., \"US History\").\n",
    "- **prompt_index**: An integer indicating which prompt from the list to use for essay generation (default is 0, which selects the first prompt in the list).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. **Prompt Selection**: For each grade-subject pair in `pairs`, the function retrieves the specified prompt from `all_prompts` using `prompt_index`.\n",
    "2. **Quality Level Assignment**: A quality level (e.g., \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", or \"F\") is randomly selected for the essay using `random.choice(quality_levels)`.\n",
    "3. **Essay Generation Prompt**: An essay prompt is constructed based on the selected prompt and assigned quality level, simulating a student essay typical of that grade and subject.\n",
    "4. **API Call**: The function sends the essay prompt to the OpenAI API (`gpt-3.5-turbo`), requesting a sample response.\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**: If prompts are missing or if `prompt_index` is out of range, an error message is printed. Any API errors are caught and logged, and the essay output for that pair is set to `None`.\n",
    "6. **Display and Storage**: Each generated essay, along with its quality level, is displayed in Markdown format and stored in a dictionary for further use.\n",

    "#### Output:\n",
    "- **Returns**: A dictionary (`all_essays`) where:\n",

       "Ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt were two distinct societies with unique political structures, social hierarchies, and religious beliefs. Mesopotamia was characterized by city-states ruled by kings who claimed divine authority. In contrast, Egypt was unified under a pharaoh who was considered a god-king. The social hierarchy in Mesopotamia was stratified, with the king and nobles at the top, followed by priests, artisans, and farmers. In Egypt, there was a similar hierarchy, but the pharaoh held the highest position with absolute power. \n",

In contrast, Egyptians held a polytheistic belief system centered around the concept of Ma'at, emphasizing harmony and balance. The development of these differences can be attributed to geographical factors such as the Nile River in Egypt, which fostered a more stable and centralized society compared to the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia. Additionally, cultural exchanges and interactions with neighboring societies influenced the religious beliefs and social structures of both civilizations."

He wanted racial equality through peace. Malcolm X, on the other hand, believed in self-defense and violent resistance. He thought that Black people needed to defend themselves against white oppression. These two leaders had a significant impact on the fight for racial equality in America, but their approaches were very different."

       "Ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt were two distinct societies with unique political structures, social hierarchies, and religious beliefs. Mesopotamia was characterized by city-states ruled by kings who claimed divine authority. In contrast, Egypt was unified under a pharaoh who was considered a god-king. The social hierarchy in Mesopotamia was stratified, with the king and nobles at the top, followed by priests, artisans, and farmers. In Egypt, there was a similar hierarchy, but the pharaoh held the highest position with absolute power. \n",

       "Religiously, Mesopotamians worshipped a pantheon of gods and goddesses, with the belief in the afterlife playing a significant role in their religious practices. In contrast, Egyptians held a polytheistic belief system centered around the concept of Ma'at, emphasizing harmony and balance. The development of these differences can be attributed to geographical factors such as the Nile River in Egypt, which fostered a more stable and centralized society compared to the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia. Additionally, cultural exchanges and interactions with neighboring societies influenced the religious beliefs and social structures of both civilizations."
