    "\n",
    "#### Description:\n",
    "- This function generates a list of assignment prompts tailored to specific grade-subject pairs using the OpenAI API.\n",
    "- The function takes a list of grade-subject pairs, constructs a unique prompt for each, and requests 10 age-appropriate assignment prompts for each pair.\n",
    "- The prompts are displayed in Markdown format within Jupyter Notebooks for easy viewing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "- **pairs**: A list of tuples, where each tuple consists of:\n",
    "  - **grade_level**: A string representing the grade level (e.g., \"11\" for 11th grade).\n",
    "  - **subject**: A string representing the academic subject for which prompts are being generated (e.g., \"US History\").\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. **Prompt Construction**: For each grade-subject pair, the function builds a specific request prompt that asks the OpenAI model to generate 10 unique, challenging, and engaging assignment prompts appropriate for that grade level and subject.\n",
    "2. **API Call**: The function sends this constructed prompt to the OpenAI API (`gpt-3.5-turbo`), instructing it to generate relevant assignment ideas.\n",
    "3. **Formatting and Cleaning**: After receiving the response:\n",
    "   - Each prompt is stripped of any leading numbering or formatting inconsistencies using regular expressions to ensure a clean display.\n",
    "   - Only the first 10 prompts are kept, even if more are returned.\n",
    "4. **Display**: Each prompt is then labeled (e.g., \"Prompt 1,\" \"Prompt 2\") and displayed in Markdown format for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "- **Returns**: A dictionary (`all_prompts`) where:\n",
    "  - Each key is a tuple of the form `(grade_level, subject)`.\n",
    "  - Each value is a list of 10 formatted assignment prompts for the corresponding grade-subject pair.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Description:\n",
    "- This function generates a sample essay for each grade-subject pair based on a specific prompt and a randomly assigned quality level. \n",
    "- It leverages a previously generated list of prompts, selects a specified prompt, and instructs OpenAI to generate a sample essay typical of a student at that grade level and subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "- **all_prompts**: A dictionary where each key is a tuple `(grade_level, subject)` and each value is a list of 10 assignment prompts generated for that grade-subject pair.\n",
    "- **pairs**: A list of grade-subject tuples, where each tuple consists of:\n",
    "  - **grade_level**: A string indicating the grade level (e.g., \"11\" for 11th grade).\n",
    "  - **subject**: A string representing the academic subject (e.g., \"US History\").\n",
    "- **prompt_index**: An integer indicating which prompt from the list to use for essay generation (default is 0, which selects the first prompt in the list).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. **Prompt Selection**: For each grade-subject pair in `pairs`, the function retrieves the specified prompt from `all_prompts` using `prompt_index`.\n",
    "2. **Quality Level Assignment**: A quality level (e.g., \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", or \"F\") is randomly selected for the essay using `random.choice(quality_levels)`.\n",
    "3. **Essay Generation Prompt**: An essay prompt is constructed based on the selected prompt and assigned quality level, simulating a student essay typical of that grade and subject.\n",
    "4. **API Call**: The function sends the essay prompt to the OpenAI API (`gpt-3.5-turbo`), requesting a sample response.\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**: If prompts are missing or if `prompt_index` is out of range, an error message is printed. Any API errors are caught and logged, and the essay output for that pair is set to `None`.\n",
    "6. **Display and Storage**: Each generated essay, along with its quality level, is displayed in Markdown format and stored in a dictionary for further use.\n",

    "#### Output:\n",
    "- **Returns**: A dictionary (`all_essays`) where:\n",

       "The Watergate scandal, which unfolded during President Richard Nixon's administration in the early 1970s, had its origins in a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. Subsequent investigations revealed a series of illegal activities orchestrated by Nixon's administration, including attempts to cover up the break-in and obstruct justice. As a result, Nixon became the first U.S. president to resign from office in 1974, facing imminent impeachment.\n",

       "The outcomes of the Watergate scandal were far-reaching and significant. The scandal eroded public trust in the government and its officials, leading to widespread disillusionment among American citizens. It also highlighted the importance of a free press and the system of checks and balances in American democracy, as journalists played a crucial role in uncovering the truth behind the scandal. The legacy of Watergate continues to serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked executive power and the importance of accountability in government."
