    "# Summary of the Essay Grading V1\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the generation of assignment prompts and realistic student responses using OpenAI's API. It integrates various components to define criteria, generate assignments, and display results in Markdown format for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Library Imports**\n",
    "The notebook begins by importing necessary libraries:\n",
    "- **`openai`**: To interact with OpenAI's API.\n",
    "- **`dotenv`**: To securely manage environment variables.\n",
    "- **`random`**: For random selection of prompts and grade-subject pairs.\n",
    "- **`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`**: Utilities for data manipulation and visualization.\n",
    "- **`IPython.display`**: For displaying content in Markdown format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Environment Variable Setup**\n",
    "- Automatically locates and loads the `.env` file containing the OpenAI API key.\n",
    "- The key is then set using `openai.api_key`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Function: `generate_prompts`**\n",
    "- Generates 10 unique assignment prompts for each grade-subject-area combination.\n",
    "- Prompts are customized based on the subject area:\n",
    "  - **Social Science**: Essay-focused.\n",
    "  - **Science**: Lab report-focused.\n",
    "  - **Language Arts**: Literary analysis-focused.\n",
    "  - **Default**: Generic critical thinking prompts.\n",
    "- Uses OpenAI API to create prompts and displays them in Markdown format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Example Usage of `generate_prompts`**\n",
    "- Demonstrates generating prompts for **11th-grade U.S. History** in the **Social Science** category.\n",
    "- Randomly selects a key and a prompt from the generated dictionary for display.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Function: `generate_assignments_with_criteria_definitions`**\n",
    "- Generates realistic student assignments based on:\n",
    "  - A fixed prompt (`deterministic_assignment_prompt`).\n",
    "  - Criteria scores for quality metrics:\n",
    "    - **Content**\n",
    "    - **Clarity**\n",
    "    - **Organization**\n",
    "    - **Relevance to Prompt**\n",
    "- Outputs assignments that align with predefined quality levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Criteria Scores**\n",
    "Defines multiple levels of quality for generated assignments:\n",
    "- **D Grade**: Scores around 60–70.\n",
    "- **B Grade**: Scores around 85–88.\n",
    "- **C Grade**: Scores around 75–80.\n",
    "- **A Grade**: Scores near 99–100.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Deterministic Assignment Prompt**\n",
    "The fixed prompt used for all generated assignments: \"Evaluate the effects of the Great Depression on American society and politics. How did the economic crisis of the 1930s reshape government intervention and social welfare policies in the United States?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Generate and Display Assignments**\n",
    "- Uses `generate_assignments_with_criteria_definitions` to produce assignments based on the criteria scores.\n",
    "- Displays the results in Markdown format, including:\n",
    "  - Criteria scores.\n",
    "  - The generated assignment text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Outputs\n",
    "- **Assignment Prompts**: 10 unique prompts for each grade-subject pair.\n",
    "- **Student Assignments**: Realistic responses reflecting specific quality levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "This notebook:\n",
    "- Simplifies prompt and assignment generation for educators.\n",
    "- Demonstrates AI-driven text generation based on predefined criteria.\n",
    "- Provides clear and structured Markdown outputs for review and analysis."

       "**Assignment Text:** The Civil Rights Movement had a profound impact on American society and politics. This era of activism, which spanned from the 1950s to the 1960s, led to significant advancements in civil rights for African Americans and other marginalized groups. One of the key outcomes of the movement was the passing of legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which aimed to end segregation and secure voting rights for all citizens.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Civil Rights Movement also brought about a shift in public attitudes towards issues of equality and social justice. Through nonviolent protests, sit-ins, and marches, activists like Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks raised awareness about the injustices faced by African Americans and inspired people across the country to join the fight for civil rights.\n",
       "\n",
       "In addition to its impact on legislation and public opinion, the Civil Rights Movement also paved the way for future movements advocating for equality and justice. The principles of nonviolent resistance and grassroots organizing employed during the Civil Rights era have influenced subsequent social movements, including the women's rights movement, the LGBTQ rights movement, and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, the Civil Rights Movement was a transformative period in American history that continues to shape the country we live in today. Its legacy can be seen in the ongoing struggle for equality and justice, as well as in the progress that has been made towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all."
