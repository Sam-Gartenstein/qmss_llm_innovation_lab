They were like, \"Hey, we gotta do something to fix this.\" So, they made new rules and programs to help people who were struggling. One example is the New Deal that President Roosevelt came up with. It was a bunch of programs to get people jobs and money.\n\nThis whole situation changed how the government works. Before, they didn't really get involved in helping out regular folks. But after the Depression, they were all about it. They made laws and set up programs to make sure people had what they needed. This was a big deal because it showed that the government could do more to help when things go wrong. It's like they became more caring or something.\n\nOverall, the Great Depression shook America up. It made the government realize they needed to step in and help out when things get tough.

They started doing things they never did before, like helping people out with jobs and money. One example is the New Deal programs by President Roosevelt, trying to lift everyone back up from the financial pit. It's like your mom suddenly coming to your rescue when you've fallen off your bike - unexpected but needed.\n\nWith all this craziness going on, social welfare policies also got a major makeover. The government realized they needed to do more to protect and care for their citizens. They started new programs to provide support for those struggling, like Social Security to help the elderly and disabled folks. It's like a safety net being woven to catch those who were falling through the cracks.\n\nThe way things were done before the Depression just didn't work anymore. The government had to change its game plan to keep the country from spiraling even further down. It's kind of like fixing a broken toy - you can't use the same old tricks; you gotta come up with new ones to make it right again.\n\nIn the end, the Great Depression was a wake-up call for America. It showed us that we needed to look out for each other better and that our government had to be more involved in making sure everyone had a fair shot. It's like learning a tough lesson the hard way, but coming out stronger and more prepared for whatever comes next."

This made the government make new rules to help out. They started things like Social Security to give money to old folks who couldn't work.\n\nThe Depression also made the government get into helping folks find jobs. They made programs like the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to give people work building stuff like roads and buildings. This was important 'cause it helped folks feed their families.\n\nAll this government help changed things. Before the Depression, the government didn't do much when people were in trouble. But after the Depression, they started doing more to keep things from getting so bad again.\n\nIn the end, the Great Depression made the government do a lot more to help people when times are tough.

It was a bunch of programs to get people jobs and money.\n\nThis whole situation changed how the government works. Before, they didn't really get involved in helping out regular folks.

This was a big deal because it showed that the government could do more to help when things go wrong. It's like they became more caring or something.\n\nOverall, the Great Depression shook America up. It made the government realize they needed to step in and help out when things get tough.

Society and politics got all shook up because of it.\n\nWhen the economy took a nosedive, the government had to step in big time. They started doing things they never did before, like helping people out with jobs and money. One example is the New Deal programs by President Roosevelt, trying to lift everyone back up from the financial pit. It's like your mom suddenly coming to your rescue when you've fallen off your bike - unexpected but needed.\n\nWith all this craziness going on, social welfare policies also got a major makeover. The government realized they needed to do more to protect and care for their citizens. They started new programs to provide support for those struggling, like Social Security to help the elderly and disabled folks. It's like a safety net being woven to catch those who were falling through the cracks.\n\nThe way things were done before the Depression just didn't work anymore. The government had to change its game plan to keep the country from spiraling even further down. It's kind of like fixing a broken toy - you can't use the same old tricks; you gotta come up with new ones to make it right again.\n\nIn the end, the Great Depression was a wake-up call for America. It showed us that we needed to look out for each other better and that our government had to be more involved in making sure everyone had a fair shot. It's like learning a tough lesson the hard way, but coming out stronger and more prepared for whatever comes next."

They started things like Social Security to give money to old folks who couldn't work.\n\nThe Depression also made the government get into helping folks find jobs. They made programs like the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to give people work building stuff like roads and buildings. This was important 'cause it helped folks feed their families.\n\nAll this government help changed things. Before the Depression, the government didn't do much when people were in trouble. But after the Depression, they started doing more to keep things from getting so bad again.\n\nIn the end, the Great Depression made the government do a lot more to help people when times are tough.
